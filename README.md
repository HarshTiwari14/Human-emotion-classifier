# Human Emotion Classifier

This repository contains a deep learning model that classifies images into two categories: Happy or Sad. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it utilizes OpenCV for image preprocessing. The project is developed and tested in a Jupyter Notebook environment, and the model is implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a neural network that can accurately classify human emotions from images. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of facial expressions and is designed to predict whether an individual is happy or sad based on their facial features.

## Installation

To get started with the Human Emotion Classifier, you need to have the following packages installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VijayMakkad/human-emotion-classifier.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd human-emotion-classifier
    ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4. Open the `Emotion_Classifier.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions within the notebook to run the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model contains images of facial expressions labeled as either 'happy' or 'sad'. You can use your own dataset or download a suitable dataset from sources like Kaggle or other open datasets. Ensure that the dataset is organized into two folders: `happy` and `sad`.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model is designed with the following layers:

1. Convolutional Layer
2. Activation Layer (ReLU)
3. Max-Pooling Layer
4. Flatten Layer
5. Dense Layer (Fully Connected)
6. Output Layer (Adam)

The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

## Results

The performance of the model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss, which are plotted in the Jupyter Notebook. For best results, you should fine-tune the model parameters and train it on a sufficiently large dataset.
